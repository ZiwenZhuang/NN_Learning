# NN_Learning
## Idea
* To learn existing neural network and put into practice on my own.

## Prerequisites
The scripts are run using python3.6. It is not garanteed that other version of python is able to run these.
Only python packages are needed, and you don't need a GPU currently, since I don't have a GPU either. And please search on the internet how to install all these packages, or you can use the requirement.txt file.
'''
    pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
* numpy
* opencv-python
* pypng
* pytorch (have to be installed manully)

BTW: I run these codes on windows. But don't forget to setup the data path in the config.py file.
